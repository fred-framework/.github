# Welcome to FRED Framework

FRED is a framework to support the design, development, and execution of **predictable software** on FPGA system-on-chips platforms.
It exploits **dynamic partial reconfiguration** and recurrent execution to virtualize the FPGA fabric, enabling the user to allocate more hardware accelerators than could otherwise fit into the physical fabric.
It integrates *automated floorplanning* and a set of runtime mechanisms to enhance predictability by scheduling hardware resources and regulating bus/memory contention.
